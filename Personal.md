**About me**
I was born in Lafayette, Indiana while my parents were in grad school at Purdue. 
Since then, I've lived in Davis, CA; Beijing, China; Palo Alto, CA; Tempe, AZ; Bellingham, WA; and, most recently, Atlanta, GA. My favorite among these is Davis.

In my free time, I read, hike, play strategy games and TTRPGs, and, occasionally, write. In summer of 2026 I will be finishing the Pacific Crest Trail, which I completed three quarters of in 2025 before coming to grad school.
