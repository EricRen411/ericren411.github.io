title: Getting Under the Skin

This is the story that technically made me a professional writer. I was paid $20 for it in 2021.

## Getting Under the Skin

&emsp; The aliens came to Earth one day and nobody knew, because they rode stealth bicycles when they came in through the warp points on our planet’s surface.    
&emsp; It started slow. One or two people out of a hundred. The worms came in and worked their magic, removing the skin from the body and setting it aside.    
&emsp; Once a worm slithers into your skin it turns it into this bloated, translucent, vaguely humanoid water balloon. Your exposed body stands to the side, unblinkingly watching before its transportation to long-term storage.    
&emsp; The beauty of it was that stealth. Nobody pays much attention to the one oddball who’s got a single fleshy eyeball rattling around inside a balloon of skin stretched tighter than a drumhead. Maybe he has some rare disease or something, who knows? Not one’s business. Inappropriate to pry, too.     
&emsp; Plus, the worms were too smart, and understood humans too well. They knew how to explain away any questions that were raised.      
&emsp; “Why do you have a rotting flap of decaying skin on your face instead of a nose?” one inquisitive coworker might ask.    
&emsp; “Ah, sinus infection,” the worm would burble. “You know how it is.”    
&emsp; “Oh, yes,” the coworker would say, and make a mental note to buy gloves.    
&emsp; So when the worm slithered into my room one night I can’t say I expected him. I learned later that they had bided their time after getting the first few, reproducing in underground caves until they could get all of the remaining uninfected in one night.    
&emsp; “Who are you?” I asked him. “Why are you here?”    
&emsp; “I’m here for your skin, Jeremiah,” said the worm. He looked almost regretful standing there, nervous, as if he wanted to leave. “Sorry it has to be this way.”    
&emsp; “Oh,” I said. “That’s alright, I guess.”    
&emsp; “Great,” said the worm. My skin melted off of me, exposing my muscles to the bite of raw air. The skin-liquid pooled and formed a puddle beneath my feet.    
&emsp; “I hope they treat you well, Jeremiah,” my worm said, stepping into the edge of the puddle. The liquid whipped up and surrounded him to reform into my skin, leaving me dry and naked.
“I did not expect to be flayed alive when I got home from work this evening,” I said, feeling a little mournful.
“I’m very sorry about that,” he said, waddling out the door. “But there was no other way.”
