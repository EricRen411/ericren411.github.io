## Chrysalis

**2:30 am, on a Monday.**       
&emsp; Stephanie couldn’t feel her face.    
&emsp; It’d become a pretty typical feeling for her on Sunday nights (well, Monday morning now, she supposed) over the summer, walking around San Marcos drunk with about ten of the eighteen other students at the Texas State pre-PhD feeder program. She could never feel her face past the sixth or seventh. Drinking was fun that way.    
&emsp; Giggling, she slapped her left palm lightly on her cheek again and let her jaw muscles slacken. She pushed the heel of her hand in until she could feel the hard outline of her teeth against it. Still couldn’t feel her face. Her cheek felt like a cotton blanket between her teeth and her hand. Soft and squishy.      
&emsp; “I can’t… feel my face,” she said. Slowly, she raised her head, nearly falling over to the right as she took her eyes off the sidewalk in front of her feet. Through the sudden moment of vertigo, she dimly realized that the young man next to her was talking to her.            
&emsp; “Hey, Stephanie,” she heard again. She languidly turned her head to face the noise, jawbone nearly resting on her shoulder. Her head felt heavy. She blinked her drooping eyelids and tried to focus on the face in front of her. The face was frowning. Which was silly, since everyone was out on town on a Sunday night (it was still Sunday, really) and you were supposed to be happy when you did that. Did Kanjam know how silly he was being?         
&emsp; “Yeah, Kanjam?” she said. “Whaddya want?”           
&emsp; “You gotta start dialing it back a little, Stephanie,” said Kanjam. “What is that, your twelfth?” He pointed at something, and Stephanie tried to draw a straight line with her eyes along the invisible axis of his extended index finger.       &emsp;  Finally, she succeeded in following it down to her right hand, which was wrapped so tightly around a can of White Claw that the metal was indented beneath her pale fingers. A slightly smushed wedge of lime hung desperately onto the rim of the can, cut earlier by the well-sharpened pocketknife of another student named Eric. Stephanie giggled. She felt like the lime.          
&emsp; “I forgot… I was holding that,” she said. “I’ll… finish it off.” She raised her hand toward her insensate face.         
&emsp; “Hey,” said the man named Kanjam, putting his hand on her wrist. “That’s enough, okay? I’m worried, Stephanie,”      
&emsp; “Hi worried,” said Stephanie, “I’m--”           
&emsp; “Seriously, Stephanie,” interrupted Kanjam. “You’ve--we’ve all got work to do tomorrow. What’s Dr. Sun going to think if you stagger in hungover again?”            
&emsp; “Doctor--” Stephanie swallowed, suppressing a sudden wave of nausea. “Doctor Sun iis a fucking bitch.”           
&emsp; “Goddamit Stephanie, you know that’s not true. Can you please admit who you’re actually mad--”          
&emsp; “And if she does call me out on it it’s only because she’s such a, such a bitch,” continued Stephanie, ignoring whatever Kanjam was trying to say. “But she can be a bitch all she wants, ‘cause I’m just out here trying to, trying to live my fucking life and, and…”           
&emsp; Her right foot stumbled on something just before she could figure out how to finish her sentence, and all of a sudden she was lying down on the concrete sidewalk right next to the grass, facing right with her left cheek in the ground. Every part of her body hurt except her face. Off in the grass, she could see a clear,  bubbly liquid trickling out the White Claw can, soon to nourish some tipsy ants. The wedge of lime lay about a foot downstream.            
&emsp; “Oh, hell,” she heard someone a thousand miles away say. “Can one of you help…”         
&emsp; The Texan night air was as cool as a running blast furnace. As she let her eyes rest, Stephanie could feel the stored heat of the sun-warmed concrete seeping in through her palms. She didn’t want to go back. She knew there were people above her arguing about how and whether to take her back. Maybe instead they’d just leave her on the sidewalk.        
&emsp; A nice smell tickled her mucous membranes. There was something nice-smelling nearby. She opened her eyes. A small, brown object that she hadn’t noticed before lay in the grass just behind the lip of the sidewalk. It was the shape of an olive and about the size of a large egg, and half of it was covered with a smooth, outer shell. The other half was bare, exposing the corrugated surface of an inner core, and overall it looked reminiscent of a chocolate almond that someone had bitten half the chocolate off of.       
&emsp; Grabbing the object, Stephanie moved it in closer to her nose and sucked deeply through her nostrils. It smelled piney and of earth. She smiled. She could feel herself falling asleep.          
&emsp; As she drifted off, she felt two sets of arms slide under her and gently lift her off the warmth of the sidewalk.        
&emsp; “What’s that she’s holding?” she heard someone say. “Can someone get her to drop it? What if she tries to like, eat it or something?” A pause. “God, she’s so far gone. Come on, let’s get her fingers open…”         
&emsp; “No, leave it.” came another voice. “It’s her Chrysalis.”          
 
**7:20 am.**
&emsp; Her ears rang. There was a sharp, insistent trilling noise that originated from something next to her head, pulsing in sync with the pain in her head. Groaning, Stephanie twitched her eyelids and got ready to push herself upright. She had to sit up before turning off her alarm, or she’d fall right back to sleep.        
&emsp; With Herculean effort she slid her arm under her prone body and drove her elbow into her mattress, turning her body over to face the ceiling. The streaky beige paint of the roof of her student-housing studio apartment greeted her as she finally got her eyes fully open. Reclining half-upright on her elbows, she let out a long sigh and began to assess the damages.          
&emsp; Legs… like lead weights.       
&emsp; Brain… approximately one of three sheets to the wind.            
&emsp; Bladder… in significant distress.      
&emsp; Bloodstream… still diffused with residual alcohol.        
&emsp; Beside her right elbow, her alarm continued its periodic reminder. She turned her head to gaze blearily at her phone screen.          
&emsp; Time until meeting with Dr. Sun… 39 minutes.          
&emsp; Time required for half-mile tired walk-shuffle to statistics building? Likely over half of that.         
&emsp; Conclusions--Get changed: yes. Wash face: yes. Pee: oh yes. Brush teeth: yes. Comb hair: no. Make tea: no. Morning run: no.       
&emsp; Finish summary for Dr. Sun of last week’s progress… no.           
&emsp; Sighing again, she swung her legs out of bed.               

&emsp; She’d just slung her backpack over her shoulder and was about to head for the door when she noticed the brown object from the night before lying in the middle of the room.      
&emsp; Should she throw it away? It was trash, wasn’t it?         
&emsp; Eh, might as well leave it there. Didn’t matter much either way.          
&emsp; Plus, she was going to be late already. Dr. Sun was fond of reminding her how busy a professor she was and how little patience she had for tardy students.          
&emsp; Stepping over the object, she left her apartment and turned right toward the Texas State Department of Statistics.      
 
**1:14 pm.**
&emsp; The meeting went on about an hour longer than planned, as meetings with Dr. Sun easily could. Feeling too exhausted to cook, Stephanie decided to go to the nearby dining hall for lunch to use up her free stipend-subsidized meal for the day. As she made her way across the nearly barren TXST campus, she pondered the dressing-down Dr. Sun had dished out that had extended out the meeting so long.           
&emsp; It had begun with an inevitable scolding for ‘forgetting’ to finish the summary that extended, as usual, into a pontification about the slovenly habits that so typically undermined promising researchers. Said monologue alone required about half an hour of the busy Dr. Sun’s and the frazzled Stephanie Martin’s time before Dr. Sun could refocus and begin the exhaustive scrutiny of every crevice of Stephanie’s week’s work required to expound at length on exactly why each part of it was wrong.           
&emsp; Sun, though severe, did ultimately mean well, however, and if Stephanie was honest with herself she’d have to admit that all of the professor’s comments would probably prove quite helpful. Still, if only her advisor wasn’t so particular… or even just gave her a compliment every now and then. Stephanie would settle for a monthly compliment.      
&emsp; Pulling open the heavy door to Harris Hall, she saw that five of the other students in her program were still there, sitting at two tables and idly chatting. After getting her oily food, Stephanie decided to sit with none of them. She sat down alone and methodically started refueling her electrolyte-starved body.       
&emsp; About halfway through her tasteless plate of refried beans, she looked up and saw that one of the other students had gotten up to leave. It was Anjelica, one of the pure math students. Stephanie vaguely remembered her being with the group the night before.           
&emsp; She was headed in an odd direction to be going for the exit. As she got closer, it dawned on Stephanie that Anjelica was headed toward her. What could she want? It wasn’t like they really knew each other. Stephanie barely even knew what Anjelica’s project was, beyond that it was in algebraic topology.            
&emsp; As the older student hung her backpack by a strap on another chair at the table and sat down next to her, Stephanie opened her mouth to greet her. Before she could, though, Anjelica spoke first.           
&emsp; “You’re having your Chrysalis,” she said.         
&emsp; “What?” said Stephanie. It couldn’t be. No, it couldn’t.         
&emsp; “What you picked up early this morning. That’s your Chrysalis.” Anjelica examined her fingers as she talked, picking a bit of dirt out from under the nail on her index finger.         
&emsp; “I… it’s just a, a tree nut or, a, an acorn or something.”         
&emsp; Anjelica looked up from her nailcare. “We all deny it when it first happens,” she said. “But we have to accept it before it--we can progress. Me, it took me almost two days to get over the denial when I had mine. Wasted valuable time. I thought I’d help you out a bit with yours.”        
&emsp; “Why does--what--how,” Stephanie felt, simultaneously, like she had both endless questions and none at all.          
&emsp; “Look. Just go back and talk to your Chrysalis, okay?”       
&emsp; “But how could you possibly know--”        
&emsp; “Just go and talk to it,” said Anjelica, already getting up to leave. “You won’t understand until you do.” She shouldered her bag to leave. “And then maybe you can ask me more questions tomorrow.”       
&emsp; Stephanie watched, mouth slightly agape, as the young woman opened the door to the dining hall and left.     
 
&emsp; The Chrysalis was this thing that happened to everyone once between the age of twenty and twenty-five that everybody knew of, but nobody talked about because you weren’t supposed to. It just wasn’t done. People would speak tangentially of it as a fact of life, if it naturally came up, but nobody did so deliberately, to dissect it and examine it and break it apart for scrutiny. That you simply didn’t do so was such an established fact that even Stephanie, who’d been one of those annoyingly curious and precocious children, knew somehow while growing up that this topic was off-limits, even for her incisive prying mind. The most she’d ever gathered was that it happened to help you with some Big Problem (™) in your life.     
&emsp; And so Stephanie didn’t even think about the Chrysalis when she turned twenty until her twenty-four-year-old brother Jacob started his, two weeks after Stephanie’s birthday. Only then, as Jacob withdrew from everyone for three days before suddenly announcing his engagement to his high school sweetheart, did she finally realize that, theoretically, such a thing could now happen to her too.        
&emsp; She thought intermittently about it as she tried to work on her project in the library. Finally, she gave up on creative work and switched to some of the endless housekeeping tasks that plague a statistics researcher so that she could think about it more. The idea still felt remote to her--distant, the way concepts like earthquake insurance had when she was fourteen. Sure, she supposed she was the right age, and sure, she supposed the thing she’d found next to the sidewalk that morning could maybe be a “chrysalis” of some sort. And… sure, she supposed she knew exactly what problem it was that the Chrysalis would have to be helping her with, if she was indeed going through her Chrysalis. The cell phone burning a hole in her pocket was reminder enough of that. Yet… some part of her still hoped that the little brown thing on the floor in her room really was just a tree nut. Or an acorn or something.        
&emsp; At around her fourth hour of work, Stephanie decided to call it for the day. Normally she would have worked more, but the combination of hangover from the early morning and exhaustion from the meeting with her advisor had left her spent. Trudging back home through the oppressive summer heat, she tried not to think about the little brown thing. As she arrived at the squat little building she called home, she decided to sit down outside for a moment, despite the sweat streaking down her face. Above her, the tops of the ash trees swayed in the gentle wind, giving her some much-needed shade.           
&emsp; Surely it was just a tree nut. Surely. The thing with her mom? Wasn’t really that big a deal. Couldn’t possibly be the thing she needed the Chrysalis to get over. She’d go inside, she’d throw the tree nut away, and she’d wait three more years to actually have her Chrysalis come and get her shit together for her. Right now, her shit could stay blessedly uncompressed. No need to pack it into a dense little shit cube yet.           
&emsp; Stephanie got up to go inside.         
&emsp; “Maybe I’ll take a dip in the river later,” she muttered as she fiddled with her door lock. “After I call Mom and after I throw away the--”          
&emsp; The lock clicked open, and the door swung open. Drawing in a sharp breath, Stephanie looked inside and let her gaze fall downward onto the brown object in the middle of her room.          
&emsp; It was definitely not a tree nut.            
 
&emsp; The Chrysalis had shed its outer shell, which lay in several pieces, like the empty rind of a watermelon, on the ground around it. Its inner core had grown into an iridescent sphere about the size of a volleyball. It shimmered in the sunlight seeping through the cracks in Stephanie’s blinds, seemingly dancing with scarcely-perceptible shapes. The air around and above it was slightly blurred, as if with heat waves, and if Stephanie squinted carefully at any point she could almost make out a pair of her own brown eyes staring back.     
&emsp; “Okay,” she said. “Okay, I’m having my Chrysalis.” She tried to pull her left foot off the ground. It wouldn’t budge. Her throat hurt, like she’d tried to swallow a baseball, and Stephanie had to fight back a sudden urge to run.        
&emsp; She had to step forward. She knew, somehow, that she had to, to touch it. Swallowing hard, she tried to pull her foot off the ground again. It came, and Stephanie jerked it forward hastily, as if afraid it would come down again without moving her. The second step was easier. The third scarcely difficult. Bringing her lagging right foot up to meet her left felt perfectly natural.             
&emsp; So slowly, she bent her knees, pushing her body down to squat with her heels flat on the ground in front of the Chrysalis. She could see it heaving in and out, stretching and shrinking as if responding to the breaths of a curled-up animal inside.          
&emsp; She reached out and laid a hand on top. Nothing happened.         
&emsp; “Hi,” she said. “Hi Chrysalis… I’m Stephanie.” Still, nothing happened.         
&emsp; “I’m here to talk to you,” she continued. “Because I think I’m supposed to and Anjelica won’t answer more of my questions unless I do. I… can you hear me? Am I—"        
&emsp; <Hello, Stephanie>, said the Chrysalis. It spoke directly in her mind, and Stephanie stiffened, nearly letting her hand go. All of a sudden, she really needed to pee.            
&emsp; <Apologies>. it said again. <I scared you.>. Its voice was breathy, like that of a library patron still deciding whether to whisper. Eerily melodic, it made Stephanie imagine that, in the Chrysalis, there were four people talking and one person singing along with them.         
&emsp; “No, not at all,” said Stephanie. “You’re all good.”       
&emsp; <I’m glad you’re finally coming to terms.>       
&emsp; “Have I?” said Stephanie. “What exactly have I supposedly come to terms with?”          
&emsp; <Your lies.>, said the Chrysalis. <Your avoidance of your problems>.        
&emsp; “Yeah,” said Stephanie. “Well, what about those things? Listen, can I ask you something? What are you, anyway?”       
&emsp; <I’m you>, the Chrysalis said.        
&emsp; “You’re an oblate spheroid of questionably biological matter with telepathic powers and curious optical properties.”        
&emsp; <Mm. I spoke imprecisely. I’m obviously not a twenty-year-old human female, but I refract parts of your identity through a lens meant to help you accept things within you that you can’t, or won’t, reach for alone. >     
&emsp; “Okay, so what is it inside me that you’re refracting that I won’t reach for alone?”        
&emsp; <What is it that you think?>       
&emsp; “Tch,” said Stephanie. “This is just like therapy all over again.” Exhaling forcefully, she ran the hand not on the Chrysalis through her brown curls.       
&emsp; “The fact that I can’t bring myself to tell my mom where I actually am,” she said. “Which, really, is a specific instance of the general fear that I’m not doing or being what it is that I’m supposed to be doing and being.” She paused.        
&emsp; <You have more to say.>           
&emsp; “But really, I’ve known about this since I was, like, 12,” she continued. “It’s been kind of obvious when I think about myself, and honestly a pretty goddamn textbook problem. Do I really need the Chrysalis to get over it? I get by on my own.”        
&emsp; <You’ve lied to her about what state you’ve been in for the past two months. She thinks you’re twelve hundred miles away from where you really are.>     
&emsp; “Yeah, and so what? Why does she need to know? How is it any of her business?”       
&emsp; <And when the summer ends?>        
&emsp; “We’ll cross that damn bridge when it comes to it. More excuses, or something. Hell, Maybe I’ve found my calling in traveling youth evangelism and won’t be coming home for another two years.” She took a deep breath. “Hell, maybe I just ghost her and never deal with it at all. Fuck her anyway. I don’t care about her.”       
&emsp; <Stop living in fantasies, Stephanie.>         
&emsp; “What, what’s fantasy about it? I get my PhD alone and become a badass data scientist, all by myself. All by myself, with no parents and no siblings and no family at all. Surely, I can do that.”          
&emsp; The Chrysalis said nothing. The silence grew long and pregnant, and eventually Stephanie focused on the rays of light flickering across the shimmering brown surface. The top of the Chrysalis rose and fell peacefully under her palm, and soon Stephanie realized how quickly she’d been breathing and how tense her shoulders were. She let muscles slacken and her lungs slow, feeling the undulation beneath her fingers, and suddenly felt tears behind her eyes, threatening to burst from her tear ducts and drip down onto the floor in front of her.      
&emsp; “Surely,” she whispered.           
 
**8:29 pm.**
&emsp; The Chrysalis had said nothing more to her, and after a while Stephanie had gotten up and cooked herself a generous bowl of tomatoes scrambled with eggs upon Chinese wheat noodles. It was a simple but filling meal, taught to her by an exchange student in her sophomore year, and Stephanie had finished it feeling soothed, with dry eyes.           
&emsp; Sitting on the balcony railing with her legs dangling over the edge, she turned her phone end over end in her hands. It was nearly the time of day when she and her mom agreed they would call each other if they did. She swiped through her phone lock screen and looked at the call history. Three weeks since they’d spoken. Last time Stephanie had initiated a call was seven weeks before that.       
&emsp; Deliberately, Stephanie thumbed her phone screen until it showed her the keypad and tapped in her mom’s number. She pressed the green button, put her headphones in, and listened to the digital drone of the dial tone. It only took a single ring.      
&emsp; “Steph!” said the voice from the other end. “Oh, I’ve missed you so much! How long has it been since you—”     
&emsp; “Ten--kind of a while,” said Stephanie. “Sorry Mom. It’s been real busy over here at the camp.”      
&emsp; “Anything noteworthy happen there this week?” her mom asked.           
&emsp; Stephanie swallowed. “Yesterday some kid had an allergic reaction and we had to get him helicoptered to the hospital.”       
&emsp; “Oh? What was it that set him off?”        
&emsp; “Dairy. A bit of butter on the meat.” Stephanie said. “Tell me about how things are going back on the farm.”     
&emsp; “Oh, they could be better,” said her mom. “Been really missing Jacob as of late. He’s doing well managing the Jones’ place with Joanna, but there’s just too much stuff for me to handle alone these days. He tries to come back and help out as much as he can, but now that they’ve had little Zach… And the hired hands… they grumble, and… oh, it’ll be much better once you’re back for good, I’m sure. Then we can finally get…”            
&emsp; Stephanie took the headphones out of her ears and buried her face in her hands, listening to the tinny voice of her mother struggling out through the tiny Bluetooth speakers as it tried to reach her ears. Peeking out through the cracks between her fingers, she could see the gray flecks in the cracked pavement a story below. Her vision swam for a moment, sending a jolt of momentary panic through her stomach as she regained her balance. Putting the earbuds back in, she swung her right leg over the railing and made to get off the balcony and go back inside.          
&emsp; “...and we’ll get the sorghum planted, try to capitalize on those hippies,” her mom was saying, “been thinking of wheatgrass for the same reason.” Stephanie tuned her out again and leaned against the frame of the sliding balcony door, watching the Chrysalis breathe. The light faded as Stephanie’s mom talked, dimming quickly as day changed to night. Eventually, at about 9:30, her mom signed off, leaving Stephanie standing alone in the dark. With the lights in her apartment off, she could only make out the faint outline of the Chrysalis’ form. She walked over to where it was, knelt down, and laid her hand back on its smooth top.          
&emsp; “What do I do now?” she whispered.           
&emsp; <I think you should go to bed early,> it murmured gently. <I think you’ll fall asleep pretty quick.>            
&emsp; Part of Stephanie preferred a screwdriver. Or six. Followed by some screaming into her pillow, or a three mile run. But instead, she brushed her teeth. Lay down in her bed. And, after just forty-seven seconds under the covers, she fell asleep.       

**12:34 pm, on a Tuesday.**
&emsp; “So you talked to it, then?” Anjelica said, not looking up from her food as Stephanie set down her things and took the seat across from the older student.        
&emsp; “Yeah, twice,” said Stephanie. “First time it gave me therapist-talk; second time it just put me to bed.”       
&emsp; Anjelica snorted. “Yeah, sounds about right,” she said. “It makes you do all the work yourself.”       
&emsp; “What do you mean?”         
&emsp; Anjelica sighed, setting down her fork and cocking an eyebrow, looking upward at the ceiling for a moment. “It’s kind of like your belayer on an indoor climbing wall. ” she said, looking back down at Stephanie. “Stops you from dying, nothing more. It’ll catch you and put you back on the wall if you fall, but it sure as hell isn’t helping you get up.”       
&emsp; “I’ve never climbed before,” said Stephanie. “I wouldn’t know.”      
&emsp; “Ach. Analogies,” said Anjelica. “What I’m trying to say is that because it can’t create anything that’s not already in you, it won’t be your support system. You’re supposed to have that externally. You need to reach out yourself.”       
&emsp; “I’m reaching out!” protested Stephanie. “I’m talking to you.”      
&emsp; “Yeah, that’s great,” said Anjelica. “But we’re not really friends, and I can’t have much of an idea of what’s really going on with your life. Even if you were to tell me, which you shouldn’t. I can only help you with the specifics of the Chrysalis, not the specifics of your actual problem.” She picked her fork back up. “Sorry,” she said. “It’s not personal. I just… you need a person who’s gotten to know you more naturally.”         
&emsp; Stephanie pursed her lips and exhaled, hard, through her nose. She stared at her uneaten food and nodded. “I guess I’ll just go then.” She stood up and shouldered her bag. Grabbing her plate, she turned around.      
&emsp; “Hey,” said the voice behind her. Stephanie turned around.          
&emsp; “What?” she said.         
&emsp; “Good luck.”      

7:19 pm
&emsp; “Chrysalis, right?” said Kanjam as he and Stephanie stood at an intersection in downtown San Marcos. They’d eaten together at one of the Indian restaurants, and Stephanie felt the curry shifting in her stomach as she fidgeted while waiting for the light to turn green.          
&emsp; “How does everyone know this?” said Stephanie. “I didn’t even know this until last night.”       
&emsp; “Anjelica told me yesterday morning,” said Kanjam. “She said you might want to talk to me about it soon.”            
&emsp; “Hell, is that girl making it her business or not? She told me to fuck off when I tried talking to her today.”        
&emsp; “I don’t think anybody here understands Anjelica,” said Kanjam. “But anyway, I’m glad. What’s going on with the Chrysalis?”        
&emsp; Stephanie opened her mouth to speak. “It--”          
&emsp; A searing pain slashed through her head, nearly causing her to fall over in pain. She felt someone had stuffed a chunk of dry ice into her skull; it felt both freezing and burning at the same time. Crying out, she staggered into a nearby telephone pole and clutched her head in her hands.       
&emsp; <He can’t know yet,> she heard in her head. <It isn’t his time.>         
&emsp; “Stephanie?” Kanjam asked. “Are you okay?”         
&emsp; “I… I can’t tell you about the Chrysalis,” she said. “Not yet. The problem it’s here for, though,” she said, breathing heavily. “The problem is my mom.”          
&emsp; “O…kay…” said Kanjam. “Well, I definitely do think it’s long overdue that you talked to someone about the problem with your mom.”           
&emsp; “I’ve talked to people.”       
&emsp; “You said that nobody else--Look, can we not do this today? Either we talk about it or we don’t, alright?” said Kanjam. “Please, just cut the bullshit for once, Stephanie; it never helps with anything. If you’ve changed your mind about talking about things, just say so and we won’t.” He put his hands in his pockets and looked at her, waiting for her to respond.       &emsp; Stephanie looked back, arms folded in front of her. To her right, the light changed, and around them other people started to cross the road. Neither of them moved. Indifferent to them, the light ticked down. 7… 6… 5… she saw it read.        
&emsp; Stephanie suppressed the urge to turn and walk across the street while it was too late for Kanjam to follow her before the light turned red. That would be, after all, exactly the kind of bullshit Kanjam had rightfully told her to cut. Relaxing her arms, she turned and pressed the button on the traffic pole so they could cross the other way. Kanjam watched her silently, hands still in his pockets.       
&emsp; “I’m sorry,” she said. “Let’s talk,” she said.       
&emsp; “Okay,” said Kanjam. “I’m sorry too, for my pushiness.” He took his hands out of his pockets and stretched his arms behind his back. “Still haven’t told your mom where you are, I’m assuming?”     
&emsp; “No,” said Stephanie. “She still thinks I’m teaching at a Bible camp up in Maine.”        
&emsp; Kanjam laughed. “You can really come up with them, can’t you.”          
&emsp; “Hey, it’s not that far-fetched! I was raised Christian.”       
&emsp; “Yeah, but you, teaching, teaching kids--anyway. You’ve been keeping that up the whole summer? Making up stories each time?”      
&emsp; “Well, I don’t call her that often. It’s not actually that hard.”         
&emsp; “Mmm,” said Kanjam. “What exactly is it that you’re afraid of? Disappointing her? Not living up to her expectations”        
&emsp; “Well… kind of?” said Stephanie. “There’s always that fear, but I’m pretty sure she’ll support me and love me no matter what happens, as long as I’m happy. She won’t be thrilled that I’ve lied to her, but… I think she’d understand. No, it’s more like… the fear that I’m failing her.”    
&emsp; “How are those different?”       
&emsp; “They’re different because what people expect of you and what you feel you ought to do for them aren’t always the same. Hell, isn’t that what’s motivated your own concern for me? She needs help on the farm, Kanjam,” said Stephanie. “She’s been all alone there since my brother moved out.        
&emsp; “Dad’s not in the picture?”         
&emsp; “Dead,” said Stephanie.         
&emsp; “Ah.” Neither person spoke for a moment. They’d made it to Sewell Park by this time and were cutting through. Stephanie, on impulse, walked off the path and sat down in the grass under one of the willow trees. Kanjam followed him.      
&emsp; “Your brother left, didn’t he? Can’t you?”        
&emsp; “To move ten miles away, sure,” said Stephanie. “So he could marry the nice-Christian-girl-next-door and raise three beautiful blond-haired-blue-eyed children on her family farm. It’s not the same as what I’m doing. Plus, he’s still around, helping her.”         
&emsp; “He’s happy doing it,” said Kanjam. “Isn’t that what matters? Not even to your mom; to him. Could you really be happy doing the same thing as him?” He paused. “You are happy doing this, right?”          
&emsp; “I… yes,” said Stephanie. “Yeah, there’s shitty, tedious nonsense. Yeah, getting stuck can get extraordinarily frustrating. Yeah, there are days when I finish work and wish I’d never left Clive, Iowa to go to college. And yeah, I wish Dr. Sun would just say something nice to me for once.”           
&emsp; “The fucking bitch,” quipped Kanjam.       
&emsp; “But I wouldn’t change how it all went,” continued Stephanie. “I love being away, all the people I’ve met, all the sights I’ve seen, all the new things I’ve experienced. I love my work; that stubborn persistence you have to have toward the problem; I feel like that kid again who, time and time again, asked question after question and pushed and pushed until something gave way for the truth. And I believe in my ability to do it well. Hell, even Dr. Sun, she only, she…”        
&emsp; “She wouldn’t spend four hours working through your project with you if she didn’t think you had potential,” said Kanjam.   
&emsp;“Yeah, that’s it.” said Stephanie. “So I’m afraid. I’m terrified of going back, because I’m scared that if I do I’ll never leave again. It was hard enough the first time, being the one kid in town to go off to school.” 
&emsp; “You want to be here, not growing old on a farm,” said Kanjam. “Letting what you began out here fall by the wayside for the sake of someone else.”       
&emsp; “Yeah,” said Stephanie. “Yeah, I do.”     
&emsp; “Then do,” said Kanjam. “Do it for yourself. From what I’ve heard, your mom is a strong person. She’ll handle it fine. She’ll probably be proud of you.”     
&emsp; “So what? I just leave her forever so I can do what I want?”     
&emsp; Kanjam pinched the bridge of his nose, furrowing his eyebrows.    
&emsp; “No, I know,” said Stephanie. “I’m being deliberately obtuse.”      
&emsp; “Yeah,” said Kanjam. “You can still be her daughter without being trapped into something you don’t want for yourself. And you can be a researcher without cutting her off completely.”       
&emsp; “Cutting her off is a cowardly move.”       
&emsp; “Yeah, that too. And I don’t think you’re a coward. You’re a strong person too. You can visit for a week and manage to leave again.”         
&emsp; Stephanie cracked him a wan smile. “Maybe,” she said. “When you put it that way. Maybe I can.”      

**9:01 pm.**
&emsp; It was dark by the time Stephanie had finished walking with Kanjam and had come back to her apartment. As she fumbled for the light in the unlit room, she wondered what exactly it was that the Chrysalis was supposed to birth. How exactly did that work, anyway? Would it just… open at some point? Would she wake up the morning after next to whatever was inside?     
&emsp; The light flicked on, illuminating the room and the Chrysalis in the center. Stephanie gasped.        
&emsp; The Chrysalis hadn’t changed overnight, and Stephanie hadn’t seen it since she’d left home in the morning. It was about as tall as her navel now and about the shape of an egg. The opaque surface had turned slightly translucent, as if the Chrysalis was a balloon whose skin had stretched thin as someone had blown it up. Inside, Stephanie could make out the floating form of a curled-up humanoid, about the size of a twelve-year-old. Its eyes were closed, and its arms were folded so closely into its body that Stephanie thought for a moment that it was sucking its thumb.        
&emsp; She put her hand on the Chrysalis and waited.      
&emsp; <You’ve worked through some things,” it said.        
&emsp; “Yeah,” said Stephanie. “Some of them.”       
&emsp; <Good,> said the Chrysalis. <That moves things along for both of us. Makes it easier for everyone.> It paused. <It’s not good for people to stay in Chrysalis for too long past the fourth day,> it said. <Most people finish resolving their issues before then,> it said, <and their Chrysalis just goes away quietly. Past the fourth day, bad things start to happen. So I’m glad you’re working on things now.>    
&emsp; “Bad things?”   
&emsp; <Yes.>       
&emsp; “How bad are the bad things that happen when the fourth day passes?”       
&emsp; <Bad.>        
&emsp; “What exactly is it that happens?”       
&emsp; A long silence.       
&emsp; <I hatch>, it finally said.     
&emsp; “How bad is that?”         
&emsp; <Bad,> it said.       
&emsp; “Okay, fuck you too then.”       
&emsp; <But they only happen when one is still at an impasse with themselves on the fourth day,> the Chrysalis continued. <That seldom occurs. Perhaps once in a million Chrysalis.> The Chrysalis seemed to stop its breathing for a moment. <I don’t think it will happen to you.>      
&emsp; “I… yeah,” said Stephanie. “No bad things for me. Like you said, I worked things out with Kanjam tonight.”      
&emsp; <Like you said. Some of them>.     
&emsp; “Enough of them,” said Stephanie. “I’ll be through soon. I’m not at any sort of impasse.”         
&emsp; The Chrysalis shook lightly. Stephanie felt its trembling beneath her fingers.         
&emsp; <Tomorrow, day three. We’ll see.>          

**8:20 pm, on a Wednesday.**
&emsp; Sitting cross-legged behind the railing of her balcony, Stephanie tried to decide whether to call her mom again. From below, in the building’s lounge, the sounds of a raucous birthday celebration floated up toward her ears. She wished she couldn’t hear it. Plenty of alcohol there, surely.        
&emsp; She’d woken up feeling confident, sure that she’d be able, at 8:30, to tie everything up nice and neat. She’d call her mom, they’d work things out, she’d go back inside, and the Chrysalis would be gone. The workday had been exceptionally productive, so much so that Stephanie had untangled a snag in her research that had plagued her for several weeks and cleared her to-do list for the first time in months. But as she finished her dinner and cleaned up the dishes in her kitchenette, the usual anxieties that had left her alone all day had come flooding back to her mind.         
&emsp; What could Kanjam know anyway? What could she know? How could she be sure that all the things they’d talked about were true? What if her mom was disappointed in her? What if her mom couldn’t manage on her own? Would it be Stephanie’s fault? Would--
Her phone awoke, interrupting her reverie. “Country roads…” it sang, belting out the ringtone Stephanie had set for her mom. “Take me home…”        
&emsp; Stephanie stiffened her lip. Her fingers closed tightly around the glass rectangle in her palm, resisting the sudden urge to fling the cell phone over the railing.    
&emsp; “To the place… where I--”        
&emsp; Stephanie slid her finger across the bottom of the screen, cutting off John Denver in the middle of his sentence. She reached for her earbuds, then remembered they were already in.        
&emsp; “Hey,” she said. “What’s up Mom?”    
&emsp; “Nothing much,” came the voice in her ears. “Just been a long day; thought I’d give you a ring to say hi. Everything good at camp?”       
&emsp; “Y-” She should tell her mom. She should tell her now. “Well… N--” Stephanie stopped. Her throat hurt, and her tongue felt like a brick in her mouth.       
&emsp; “What’s wrong?” she heard her mom say. “Is something bothering you?”       
&emsp; “Ye--I--” Her eyes felt watery. “No,” she said. “No, we just talked about…” she searched her head, trying to remember her Bible trivia. “The prodigal son,” she said. “And this one kid started talking about his own family and it got me thinking…” she trailed off.            
&emsp; “Thinking?”            
&emsp; “About whether I’m like the younger son,” she said. “Letting you down. Leaving you like this for four years. Coming back only after I’ve had my silly fun with math and, and college, and… this summer where I…”         
&emsp; Say it, Stephanie. Say it.       
&emsp; “Camp counseled all the way off in Maine,” she finished. Dammit. Dammit, Stephanie.        
&emsp; “Oh,” her mom murmured. “Oh, Stephanie,” she said. “No, you haven’t let me down at all.”        
&emsp; “Really?” said Stephanie.         
&emsp; “Yes,” her mom said. “All the time when you were growing up I thought you would go on to leave town. That a life like mine would never be what you needed. Heck, even those endless notes from your teachers about your boredom-driven behavioral issues only made me more proud of you. The day you left Clive for school was the proudest day of my life.”        
&emsp; “I…”       
&emsp; “And now, the thought that you’d give it all up to come back for me? Steph, you’re a more selfless and Christ-like person than I ever was.”      
&emsp; “Mom…”        
&emsp; “I only pray that it doesn’t turn into regret for you, Stephanie, once you come--”   
&emsp; “Mom!”     
&emsp; “...Yes?”          
&emsp; Stephanie blinked hard. She took a deep breath.        
&emsp; “Thank you,” she said. “That means a lot to me.”        
&emsp; “Of course, Steph. It’s only true.”          
&emsp; “Sorry I cut you off, but I have to go,” Stephanie said. “Someone needs me.” She bit her lip. “Camp stuff. You know.”    
&emsp; “Oh, alright,” her mom said. “We’ll talk plenty once you come back anyway.”       
&emsp; “Yeah,” said Stephanie. She bit down harder on her lip. “Bye.”       

&emsp; The Chrysalis was the same size when she came back in from the balcony. Wiping away sweat from her face with her left forearm, Stephanie laid her right palm atop it again.       
&emsp; <You appear to be at an impasse,> it said.          
&emsp; “Shut up,” said Stephanie. Silence. The Chrysalis’ surface rose and fell, seemingly in tandem with Stephanie’s own breathing.          
&emsp; “What did talking with Kanjam even do for me anyway?” she said finally. “Felt better for a night, but now I’m back in the same place I’ve been for weeks. There’s clearly been only one solution to this problem the whole time. One good one anyway.”      
&emsp; The Chrysalis didn’t answer.       
&emsp; “So why can’t I go through with it?” said Stephanie. “Why can’t I do it?” She stretched her neck, trying to work the ache out of it. “Fuck, I’m tired of analysing myself. Tired of your cryptic nonsense. I need… at least eight drinks right now. That’s what I need.”       
&emsp; No answer.            
&emsp; “Tch. What use are you anyway? You can’t give me anything I don’t already have in me. Kanjam can’t give me anything I don’t already have in me. So who am I supposed to go to? Hmm? Do I just keep fucking around in circles until you hatch and the ‘bad things’ start happening?”         
&emsp; The Chrysalis stirred, vibrating like it held a tuning fork.         
&emsp; “How long do I have, anyway?”         
&emsp; The Chrysalis didn’t answer.            
&emsp; “The fourth day, right? Tomorrow?”        
&emsp; <If you are to decide, yes. It must be tomorrow,> it said.         
&emsp; “Can you help me?” Stephanie asked. “Anything?”       
&emsp; <Not until then,> it said.       
&emsp; “Tch,” said Stephanie, taking her hand off the Chrysalis. Turning around, she headed downstairs to go to the birthday party.
	
&emsp; The first thing she saw as she walked in was Eric, cutting limes again with his beloved pocketknife over paper towels on the table directly in front of her. Behind him, among others, sat Anjelica on a couch, swirling what appeared to be a glass of tequila and steadfastly ignoring the advances of an eager-looking young Russian man sitting on the couch’s armrest. Striding past the fruit butchery in the middle of the room, Stephanie took the other seat on the couch--directly between Anjelica and the man, who was explaining to Anjelica the details of his latest publication on the Galois symmetries of 3-manifolds.     
&emsp; Laconically, Anjelica looked up from her drink. She smirked, and Stephanie almost thought she looked glad to see her.      
&emsp; “So you’re here,” she said. “Was wondering if you’d end up coming.” The young man stammered, cut off in the middle of his sentence.   
&emsp; “So, um. As I was saying, the automorphisms of--”.       
&emsp; “Oh, shut up,” said Stephanie. “Take a hike, will you?” She turned away without waiting for a response. Anjelica, draping her arm over the side of the couch, laughed.        
&emsp; “Thank you for that,” she said. “The guy thinks he’s the next Perelman, I swear.” She took a long drink from her cup. “I take it you’ve resolved your Chrysalis situation?”       
&emsp; “No,” said Stephanie. “I couldn’t deal with its shit anymore.”       
&emsp; The smile vanished from Anjelica’s face. An uncharacteristic frown set into her face. Setting her drink down on her armrest, she turned her entire body in the couch to face Stephanie.       
&emsp; “Tomorrow is your fourth day, isn’t it?” she said.      
&emsp; “Yeah, but what could really--I mean--the thing hatches, so what?” said Stephanie.     
&emsp; “Stephanie,” said Anjelica. “When it hatches, it’s quite possible that you die.”     
&emsp; “What?”         
&emsp; “You’re going to question how I know. You don’t have that luxury of uncertainty. I know. Mine hatched.”       
&emsp; “Can’t you--can’t you tell me anything more?”       
&emsp; “I… I’m sorry but, I just can’t,” said Anjelica. “I’ve tried before, but I just can’t get the words to form,” she said. “You understand? I can’t.” She raised her glass again. Both women sat as she drained the whole thing, her throat muscles bulging as she swallowed each gulp. The older woman lowered her glass, gasping.      
&emsp; “I’ll tell you if--when I see you tomorrow,” she said. “But right now… I’m sorry.”       
&emsp; Stephanie closed her eyes, nodding slightly to herself. Looking up, she opened her eyes and nodded once to Anjelica.          
&emsp; “I think I gotta go now,” she said.      
&emsp; “Yes, that sounds like a good idea,” said Anjelica.        
&emsp; Stephanie started to get up, but halfway through her motion, a thought popped into her head.      
&emsp; “I need something from this room,” she said. Anjelica frowned. Her eyes flicked around the room, darting from one object to the next. Stephanie stared blankly ahead, focusing in on nothing. Suddenly, she realized what she wanted. Standing up, she left the confused Anjelica and walked over to the seat where Eric had sat down after cutting the limes.      
&emsp; “I need you to give me your knife,” she said. “You can have it back tomorrow once I’m done.”       
&emsp; Eric looked at her as if she’d asked him to give her his firstborn child. “What?” he said.         
&emsp; “Give her the knife,” said Anjelica from her couch. Stephanie turned around. The young topologist no longer looked confused.         
&emsp; “Why should--”        
&emsp; “Yes, give it to her,” chimed in a couple other voices from around the room. Looking around, Stephanie felt a sense of belonging with them. Like they all shared something. Taking a deep breath, Stephanie held out her hand for the knife.      
&emsp; “Okay…” muttered Eric, reaching into his pocket. “Take it…” Stephanie did. Feeling the eyes of everyone on her retreating back, she left the lounge for home.    

&emsp; The knife’s weight felt comforting in her hands, and Stephanie, despite the looks she drew, kept it unfolded as she ascended the stairs to her apartment. Its serrations glinted in the flickering fluorescence of the hallway, and Stephanie thought she could see the marks on the edge where Eric’s whetstone had been. She understood finally why Eric carried the thing everywhere now. It felt reassuring to hold.        
&emsp; Keeping the three-inch blade close to her chest, she gave the Chrysalis as wide a berth as she could in the small room. Not even bothering to take off her shoes, she clambered into bed as best she could without letting go of the knife and sat with her knees to her chest, staring unblinkingly at the breathing Chrysalis.         
&emsp; She never had gotten those eight drinks.        

&emsp; The night dragged on, and at some point the sounds of the revel downstairs died down. Stephanie contemplated the prospect of going downstairs to finish off the leftover liquor. She was always defaulting to alcohol to avoid her problems wasn’t she? What a Chrysalis-like admonition that was. Maybe the thing was already too deep in her head. Maybe she’d live, but never quite be Stephanie Martin again. Would that even be better than dying?        
&emsp; Stephanie didn’t know. She felt too tired to know. So much had happened in the past few days, with the Chrysalis and with Kanjam and with Mom and with Anjelica… maybe in a few hours she would be dead, but that was for in-a-few-hours-Stephanie-Martin to handle. Maybe now… maybe now she would go to sleep.     
&emsp; The pocketknife slipped out of her loosening grip, landing softly onto her comforter. Stephanie felt her eyes close, then felt nothing.       

**6 am, on a Thursday.**
&emsp; One moment, Stephanie was unconscious; the next, she was awake. She breathed in deeply as wakefulness crashed through her like a disintegrating derailed train. Her hands roved frantically around the bed for the knife. Closing her fingers around it, she leapt out of bed with it held in front of her and looked up at where she knew the Chrysalis to be.          
&emsp; The tip of it nearly brushed the ceiling now, and its skin looked almost fully transparent. Inside, Stephanie could see the form of an adult human woman. It wore the attire of a midwestern farmer, and its head, covered in the brown curls that only Stephanie had developed in her family, bobbed up and down as the Chrysalis breathed. Its face looked about fifty, and its hair was slashed with streaks of grey.       
&emsp; “You’re still here, huh?” said Stephanie. She kept her knees bent slightly, knife at ready.     
&emsp; About a minute passed before Stephanie let out the breath she’d been holding. Inhaling and exhaling deeply again, she lowered the knife down from her chest and sighed.        
&emsp; “Fuck you,” she said. “I’m getting a drink of water.” She walked toward one side of the Chrysalis, moving to pass it on its right. As she did so, she lashed out with her foot and kicked at it in frustration. “Bitch.”      
&emsp; Her foot, meeting something unresisting, plowed straight through, and Stephanie nearly staggered backward as it swung forward much further than she’d expected. Whirling around, she saw that the membrane of the Chrysalis was dissolving, bursting holes around its curved surface that expanded until they met and consumed the entire exterior. A clear, watery liquid gushed away in all directions, cascading down to the ground before disappearing, as if the floor of Stephanie’s apartment had been replaced with an enormous sieve.       
&emsp; Inside, the creature stirred. Its legs and arms quivered. Close as she stood, Stephanie could see a pair of wings on its back, shivering across its back. The skin on its face was pure chitin, she realized now. There were bottomless black pits where its eyes should have been.     
&emsp; As the last of the liquid sloughed off its body, it raised its head, stretched upright, and took a step closer to Stephanie. The young student felt paralyzed. Her mouth hanging slightly open, she could barely remember to breathe.        
&emsp; An arm stretched toward Stephanie’s right hand, which held the knife. Another stretched toward her face.       
&emsp; “Kill me,” it rasped. Gone were the melodic, breathy tones from before. This voice sounded like an aluminum bat being dragged over gravel.       
&emsp; Stephanie tried to force air out of her mouth.           
&emsp; “Or don’t,” it said, stepping forward more. “You must decide now.”          
&emsp; “I,” breathed Stephanie. “I can’t--“ Distantly, she felt something metallic moving in her hand.          
&emsp; “Only one of us leaves, Stephanie,” the Chrysalis said. “And I... I don’t think anymore that I want to die.” She leaned her face closer to Stephanie’s. Stephanie stared, gaze riveted to the empty holes in the Chrysalis’ head. As she watched the creature’s head get closer, she felt the metallic thing move in her hand again.       
&emsp; Metallic…      
&emsp; Her eyes widened, and she jerked her head downward toward Eric’s knife. The creature had turned it all the way around in her hand. Its point faced directly inward toward Stephanie’s chest. Screaming, she pushed its hand away and raised her fist, stabbing downward at the creature’s upturned face. The knife entered it through its right cheek, drawing a sepia rivulet of watery blood where it cleaved away the chitin, and Stephanie heard it shriek so loudly as it collapsed to the ground that her eardrums hurt. She fell on top of its writhing body, thrusting the knife in again and again into its shoulder, its chest, its groin, its back; everywhere she could think of until the shrieking stopped and Stephanie knew that it was dead. Dropping the knife, she cradled her blood-soaked knees and sobbed, trying desperately to catch her ragged breath.           
&emsp; But after a while the tears ran out, and Stephanie Martin opened her eyes to find her arms and knees completely clean of the blood that had stained them just minutes before. Standing up and brushing the carpet-dust off her legs and torso, she walked to her nightstand, grabbed her toothbrush, and went to her bathroom to brush her teeth. After that she decided on a long shower, rinsing the sweat, dust, and tears off her pale skin. Toweling off and putting on some clothes, she sat out on the balcony for a while with her headphones in and her phone in her hand, watching the sun come over the horizon. 
&emsp; At long last, she turned on the phone and dialed the familiar number.
